# Outfit Image Scraper (Google Images)

This is a simple Python script that helps you download outfit images (like formal and casual clothes) from Google Images using Selenium.

## ✨ What It Does

- Searches Google Images for specific outfit types
- Downloads the images automatically
- Resizes them to 224x224 pixels
- Saves them in organized folders

## 📂 Categories Included

The script downloads images for these 4 categories:

- Formal outfits for men
- Formal outfits for women
- Casual outfits for men
- Casual outfits for women

Each category is saved in its own folder inside the `outfits/` directory.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8 to 3.11  
- Google Chrome browser  
- ChromeDriver (should match your Chrome version)

Install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install selenium pillow requests
```

## 🚀 How to Use

Just run the script:

```bash
python image_scraper.py
```

It will open a browser in the background, search for each outfit type, and save the images automatically.

## 🔢 Want More or Fewer Images?

By default, it saves 50 images per category. You can change that in the script:

```python
download_images(query, f"outfits/{category}", num_images=50)
```

Change `50` to any number you like.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

After it runs, your folders will look like this:

```
outfits/
├── casual_outfits_men/
├── casual_outfits_women/
├── formal_outfits_men/
└── formal_outfits_women/
```

Each folder will have your downloaded `.jpg` images.

💡 **Note:** This is meant for learning and personal use only. Google might block or limit scraping, so don’t go overboard.

Happy coding! 👕📸
